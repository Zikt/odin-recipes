    <h2> Description </h2>

    <p> This soup is native to West Africa (Nigeria) and 
        many of my American as well as Nigerian friends 
        have enjoyed it. It is a great soup for those 
        who like to try something different every once 
        in a while. Ground Egusi seeds give this soup a 
        unique color and flavor. If you can't find Egusi 
        seeds, you can substitute pumpkin seeds. Any 
        combination of crab, shrimp and smoked fish can
         be used in place of the shrimp. Drained, smoked
          oysters and chicken can be used in place of the 
          beef.
